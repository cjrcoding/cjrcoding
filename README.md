# 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos Javier Rivera

Creative builder bridging **blockchain** and **storytelling** — one smart contract, one scene, one idea at a time.

🎭 From the worlds of **film and television** to the decentralized edges of Web3, I’ve always believed in the power of systems and symbols to move people. Today, I'm focused on building apps, tools, and experiences on the **Cardano blockchain**, using languages like **Haskell**, **Aiken**, and **Rust**.

- 🎨 **Color Changer App** – a validator-based concept where on-chain interactions evolve the front-end  
- ⏱ **Pomodoro Timer** – functional time-tracking tool built in Haskell
