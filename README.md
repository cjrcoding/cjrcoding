# 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos

Creative technologist blending art, code, and community.

With a background in film, TV, and stage, and I bring that same intention and rhythm to my work in code. Today, I'm focused on building on the **Cardano blockchain**, using languages like **Haskell**, **Aiken**, and **Rust**.

- **Smart Contract Lab** – *Development phase*: a modular playground for building, testing, and evolving smart contracts on Cardano  

- **Rugswap.io** – *Prototype phase*: a conceptual collectible-for-collectible NFT swap platform, focused on security, community, and themed achievement rewards
