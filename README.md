# 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos

Creative technologist blending art, code, and community.

🎭 I come from the world of storytelling — with a background in film, TV, and stage — and I bring that same intention and rhythm to my work in code. Today, I'm focused on building apps, tools, and experiences on the **Cardano blockchain**, using languages like **Haskell**, **Aiken**, and **Rust**.
